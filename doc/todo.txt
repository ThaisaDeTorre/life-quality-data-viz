So, what is the correlation between these scores and crime?
----
Results:
According to the chart, there is a positive correlation between the Smartcity_Index and the Smart_Government, Smart_Living, and Crime_Indexes. This means that countries with higher Smartcity_Index scores tend to have higher Smart_Government, Smart_Living, and lower Crime_Index scores. This suggests that investing in Smartcity initiatives can lead to improvements in government efficiency, quality of life, and public safety.
