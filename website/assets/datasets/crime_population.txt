Research Question:
In our exploration spanning the years 2013 to 2020, we decide to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of European countries. Our primary focus is understanding the nuanced dynamics between population and crime rates. The overarching objective is to extract valuable insights that shed light on the unique characteristics of each country. Furthermore, we aim to discern prevalent trends in both population and crime, unraveling whether these rates exhibit a discernible pattern of growth or decline.

Data Elaboration:
For the creation of our visualization, we meticulously curated data from Eurostat, relying on two distinct datasets. The first dataset encapsulates the population figures of European countries from 2012 to 2020, while the second delves into the rates of crime, encompassing violence and vandalism, for the same temporal span. A pivotal initial step involved ensuring that the data, whether in its raw form or following preprocessing, was adeptly scaled. This meticulous process aimed to eliminate the inherent biases stemming from variations in country sizes.

To capture the ebb and flow of these variables, we opted to calculate the differences between consecutive years. This provided us with a granular perspective on the exact changes occurring within each country. The preliminary visualization, thus crafted, presented a snapshot of these changes. However, recognizing the need for a more insightful portrayal, we embarked on a journey beyond Flourish, venturing into Excel.

In Excel, we undertook the task of generating trend lines for every country, encompassing both population and crime metrics. The ensuing equations derived from these trend lines added an invaluable layer of context to our analysis. To seamlessly integrate this newfound depth into our visualization, we meticulously crafted a sequence of points. These points, representing the trajectories defined by the trend lines, were then embedded as new columns for each country. This strategic augmentation facilitated Flourish in rendering a visually compelling narrative of the overarching trends.

Insights:
This dynamic visualization emerges as a potent lens through which we can scrutinize the temporal evolution of population and crime rates across European countries. As we traverse the temporal spectrum, we gain insights into the nuanced changes transpiring within each country. Moreover, the discernment of positive or negative trends furnishes a pivotal understanding of whether these rates are experiencing an upward surge or a downward trajectory.

The comparative aspect of the visualization extends beyond mere observation, enabling us to draw parallels and distinctions between countries. This, in turn, facilitates the identification of potential correlations between population and crime rates. In essence, our visualization serves not only as a repository of historical shifts but also as a tool for uncovering the intricate tapestry of interrelations that define the socio-demographic landscape of European nations.
